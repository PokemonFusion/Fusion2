"""Admin registrations for the Pok√©mon app.

This module connects Django models to the admin interface.  The game's test
suite often runs in a lightweight environment where the ORM isn't fully
configured.  When that happens the imported model references become ``None``.
Attempting to register ``None`` with ``admin.site`` raises ``TypeError``.

To keep these environments usable we skip registration for any missing models.
