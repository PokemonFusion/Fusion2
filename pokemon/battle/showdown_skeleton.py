"""Skeleton mapping of the Pokémon Showdown battle process.

This module contains placeholder functions that outline the main loop
and move execution structure described in ``simulator-doc.txt`` from
Pokémon Showdown. Each function corresponds to an event mentioned in
the pseudocode. Unknown behaviour is noted and the function currently
performs no logic so tests will pass while the overall design is laid
out.
