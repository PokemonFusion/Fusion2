You can replace the CSS files for Evennia's homepage here.

`pokefusion.css` provides the Pokémon-themed skin and includes `.type-chip`
definitions for all Pokémon types. Edit this file when changing chip colors or
styles.

`custom.css` holds local layout tweaks and overrides. It no longer defines
type-chip classes; leave Pokémon-type styling in `pokefusion.css`.

You can find the original Evennia files in `evennia/web/static/website/css/`.
