# Pokemon Fusion 2 Test Server

This project is an experimental MUD built with [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/). It aims to reimagine the world of Pokémon in a text-based multiplayer setting. The repository hosts the game code as well as data files for Pokémon, regions and mechanics.

Please note that the server is under heavy development. You can follow progress on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PokemonFusion/Fusion2) and report issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/PokemonFusion/Fusion2/issues).

For setup instructions and other notes migrated from the original Evennia README, see [README.instructions.md](README.instructions.md).
